# Game Creation Together
Hi and welcome to the Game Creation Together project! This is a collaborative game development project managed by the Game Creation Club at The Ohio State University.

This project is currently using Godot 4.4 and purely GDScript. You'll see C# as part of the languages of the project, but that's as part of an addon and won't be included in the final build. Don't use C# if you'd like to contribute.

If you'd like to play the project, you can play it on [our itch.io page](https://gccatosu.itch.io/game-creation-together).

If you'd like to contribute to the project, please see [our wiki](https://github.com/GameCreationClubOSU/GCT2025/wiki). It'll have instructions on installation, contribution, and submission.

## Getting Started
If you're already familiar with all the tools, here's a quick rundown:

You will need Godot 4.4. Both .NET and standard Godot will work, but we are working in purely GDScript. Fork and clone the repo or download the project as a zip file. You should be able to import it into Godot from there.
